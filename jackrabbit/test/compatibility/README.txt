The repository zip file contains pre-generated Jackrabbit repositories
from past releases and configurations. If you make changes to the repository
content or add new versions, you can update the repository zip file by
running "mvn clean install" and using the result from the target directory
to replace jackrabbit-webapp/src/test/resources/compatibility.zip.
