dav.name = Apache Jackrabbit DavEx Servlet
dav.description = The DavEx Servlet allows direct access to the \
 complete Repository.

alias.name = Root Path
alias.description = The root path at which the DavEx Servlet is \
 accessible. The default value is "/server".

missing-auth-mapping.name = Missing Credentials Handling 
missing-auth-mapping.description = Defines how a missing authorization \
 header should be handled. If this property is missing, a 401 response \
 is generated. This is suiteable for clients (eg. webdav clients) for \
 which sending a proper authorization header is not possible if the \
 server never sent a 401. If this property is present with an empty \
 value, null-credentials are returned, thus forcing an null login \
 on the repository. If this propert is present with the value \
 'guestcredentials' java.jcr.GuestCredentials are used to login to the \
 repository. If this property has a 'user:password' value, the \
 respective simple credentials are generated.

authenticate-header.name = Realm>
authenticate-header.description = Defines the value of the \
 'WWW-Authenticate' header. Default is 'Basic realm="Jackrabbit Webdav Server"'.
 
csrf-protection.name = CSRF Protection
csrf-protection.description = Configuration of referrer based CSRF \
 protection. If config is not configured or empty string the default \
 behaviour is to allow only requests with an empty referrer header or a \
 referrer host equal to the server host. A comma separated list of \
 additional allowed referrer hosts which are valid in addition to default \
 behaviour (see above). The value "disabled" may be used to disable the \
 referrer checking altogether. The default is "disabled" assuming that \
 a site-wide CSRF protection filter is installed.
