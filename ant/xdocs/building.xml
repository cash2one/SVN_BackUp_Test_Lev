<section name="Building JMeter and Add-Ons">
<note>
<b>Note to developers:</b>
This is a very brief overview. 
There is more information on the <a href="http://wiki.apache.org/jmeter">JMeter Wiki</a> or in <code>eclipse.readme</code> in root folder of sources.
</note>
<h2>Building Add-Ons</h2>
<p>
There is no need to build JMeter if you just want to build an add-on.
Just download the binary archive and add the jars to the classpath or use Maven artifacts to build your add-ons.
You may want to also download the source so it can be used by the IDE.
</p>
<p>See the <code>extras/addons*</code> files in the source tree for some suggestions</p>

<h2>Building JMeter</h2>
<h3>Acquiring the source</h3>
<p>The full source is distributed alongside the binary, it can also be downloaded from SVN or found on <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/apache/jmeter">Apache JMeter Github Mirror</a> .</p>
<p>
The source archive and SVN do not contain any of the required library files. 
These need to be downloaded by running the Ant command:</p>
<source>
ant download_jars
</source>
<p>Or you can download the binary distribution archive for a release and unpack it into the same directory structure as the source.
This will ensure that the <code>lib/</code> directory contains the jar files needed for running JMeter.
There are a few additional jars that are needed to build JMeter, download these using:
</p>
<source>
ant download_jars
</source>
<p>
This will retrieve any missing jars.
</p>
<h3>Compiling and packaging JMeter using Ant</h3>
<p>
JMeter can be built entirely using Ant.
The basic command is:</p>
<source>
ant [install]
</source>
See build.xml (or call <code>ant -p</code>) for the other targets that can be used.
<h3>Compiling and packaging JMeter using Eclipse</h3>
<p>
Once you have downloaded the source from SVN or the release archives and run the ant <code>download_jars</code> target to
install the dependent jars, you can configure Eclipse. The easiest way to do this is to replace the Eclipse <code>.classpath</code>
file with the <code>eclipse.classpath</code> file provided with JMeter. This will set up the source-paths and most of the libraries.
</p>
<p>
Ensure you read <code>eclipse.readme</code> for project configuration.
