/**
 * A tokenizer is responsible to return a token list for the provided input file (see {@link SourceCode#getFileName()}.
 * Tokens are basically list of non empty words in a file but you can also do some "anonymization" to ignore litteral differences.
 * 
 * For example if you have a first file:
 * <pre>
 * public class MyClass1 {
 *   int foo1;
 * }
 * </pre>
 * and a second file:
 * <pre>
 * public class MyClass2 {
 *   int foo2;
 * }
 * </pre>
 * Then in both cases your tokenizer could return the following (line, image) list:
 * <pre>(1,public),(1,class),(1,LITERAL),(1,{),(2,int),(2,LITERAL),(2,;),(3,})</pre>
 * in this case the two files will be considered as duplicate.
