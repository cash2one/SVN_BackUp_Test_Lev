/**
 * <p>
 * A Sensor is invoked once during the analysis of a project. The sensor can parse a flat file, connect to a web server... Sensor are
 * generally used to add measure at the lowest level of the resource tree. A sensor can access and save measures on the whole tree of
 * resources.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * For example the Cobertura Sensor parses Cobertura report and saves the first-level of measures on resources.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * A particular attention should be given to resource exclusion. Sonar already manages exclusions at file level : if you try to save a
 * measure on a resource that is excluded in the settings, then Sonar will not save the measure. When handling a plugin or an external tool,
 * you should make sure that exclusions are passed if you are going to get back consolidated data.
