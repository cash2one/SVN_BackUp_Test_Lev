/**
 * Function used to calculate the remediation cost of an issue. There are three types :
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 * <b>Linear</b> - Each issue of the rule costs the same amount of time (coefficient) to fix.
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <b>Linear with offset</b> - It takes a certain amount of time to analyze the issues of such kind on the file (offset).
 * Then, each issue of the rule costs the same amount of time (coefficient) to fix. Total remediation cost
 * by file = offset + (number of issues x coefficient)
 * </li>
 * <li><b>Constant/issue</b> - The cost to fix all the issues of the rule is the same whatever the number of issues
 * of this rule in the file. Total remediation cost by file = constant
