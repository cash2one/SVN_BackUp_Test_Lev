/**
 * The {@code RegionPainter} interface defines exactly one method, {@code paint}.
 * It is used in situations where the developer can change the painting routine
 * of a component without having to resort to subclassing the component.
 * It is also generically useful when doing any form of painting delegation.
 * <p>
 * Painters are simply encapsulations of Java2D code and make it fairly trivial
 * to reuse existing painters or to combine them together.
 * Implementations of this interface are also trivial to write,
 * such that if you can't find a painter that does what you need,
 * you can write one with minimal effort.
