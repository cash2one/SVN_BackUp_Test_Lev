Reports any references to classes which allow the class name to
be used outside the class's stated scope. For instance, this inspection would report
a <b>public</b> method which returns a <b>private</b> inner class, or a <b>protected</b> field whose
type is a package-visible class. While legal Java, such references can be very
confusing, and make reuse difficult.
