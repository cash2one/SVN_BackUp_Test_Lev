Apache Derby is a pure Java, standards-based relational database engine.
Derby provides an easy to use data management solution for
software developers with zero administration for end users.
<p>
Derby runs on any Java SE 6 platform or higher with 4.0, 4.1, and 4.2.
For Java 8, Derby can also run on constrained devices
with a runtime as specified by OpenJDK JEP 161, i.e. Compact Profile 2
or higher.
</p>
Derby's database format is platform independent allowing databases to be copied to
any machine type.
