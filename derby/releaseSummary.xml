<a href="http://db.apache.org/derby/derby_downloads.html">Derby download page</a>.
</p>

<p>
Apache Derby is a pure Java relational database engine using standard SQL and
JDBC as its APIs. More information about Derby can be found on the
<a href="http://db.apache.org/derby/">Apache web site</a>.
Derby functionality includes:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Embedded engine with JDBC drivers</li>
<li>Network Server</li>
<li>Network client JDBC drivers</li>
<li>Command line tools: ij (SQL scripting), dblook (schema dump) and sysinfo (system info)</li>
</ul>

<p>
Java and JDBC versions supported:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Java SE 6 and higher with JDBC 4.0, 4.1, and 4.2.</li>
  <li>Java SE 8 compact profile 2.</li>
</ul>
</overview>

<newFeatures>

<p>
This is a feature release. The following new features were added:
</p>

<ul>

<li><b>MERGE statement</b> - MERGE is a single, join-driven statement which INSERTs, UPDATEs, and DELETEs rows. See the section on this statement in the Derby Reference Manual. See also features F312, F313, and F314 of the SQL Standard.</li>

<li><b>Deferrable constraints</b> - Constraint enforcement can now be deferred, typically to the end of a transaction. See the section on "constraintCharacteristics" in the Derby Reference Manual. See also features F721 and F492 of the SQL Standard.</li>

<li><b>WHEN clause in CREATE TRIGGER</b> - An optional WHEN clause has been added which determines which rows fire a trigger. See the section on this clause in the Derby Reference Manual. See also feature T211-05 of the SQL Standard.</li>

<li><b>Rolling log file</b> - The Derby diagnostic log can now be split across a sequence of files. See the section on the derby.stream.error.style property in the Derby Reference Manual.</li>

<li><b>Experimental Lucene support</b> - Derby text columns can now be indexed and queried via Apache Lucene. See the section on the optional luceneSupport tool in the Derby Tools and Utilities Guide.</li>

<li><b>Simple case expression</b> - The "simple" and "extended" syntax for CASE expressions has been added. See the section on the CASE expression in the Derby Reference Manual. See also features F261-01, F262, and F263 of the SQL Standard.</li>

<li><b>Better concurrency for identity columns</b> - The concurrency of identity columns has been boosted. See the detailed release note for DERBY-6542 below.</li>

<li><b>New ij HoldForConnection command</b> - A new ij command has been added to change the default cursor holdability to "keep cursors open after commit." See the section on the HoldForConnection command in the Derby Tools and Utilities Guide.</li>

<li><b>Standard syntax for altering column nullability</b> - Standard syntax has been added for altering the nullability of columns. See the section on ALTER TABLE in the Derby Reference Manual. See also feature F383 of the SQL Standard.</li>

</ul>

    These are the instructions for verifying the signed distributions. Probably you
    won't need to touch this section.

<releaseVerification>

<p>It is essential that you verify the integrity of the downloaded
files using the PGP and MD5 signatures.  MD5 verification ensures the
file was not corrupted during the download process.  PGP verification
ensures that the file came from a certain person.</p>

<p>The PGP signatures can be verified using
<a href="http://www.pgpi.org/">PGP</a> or
<a href="http://www.gnupg.org/">GPG</a>.
First download the Apache Derby
<a href="http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/db/derby/code/trunk/KEYS">KEYS</a>
as well as the <code>asc</code> signature file for the particular
distribution. It is important that you get these files from the ultimate
trusted source - the main ASF distribution site, rather than from a mirror.
Then verify the signatures using ...</p>

<pre>
% pgpk -a KEYS
% pgpv db-derby-X.Y.tar.gz.asc

<em>or</em>

% pgp -ka KEYS
% pgp db-derby-X.Y.tar.gz.asc

<em>or</em>

% gpg --import KEYS
% gpg --verify db-derby-X.Y.tar.gz.asc

</pre>

<p>To verify the MD5 signature on the files, you need to use a program
called <code>md5</code> or <code>md5sum</code>, which is
included in many unix distributions.  It is also available as part of
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/textutils/textutils.html">GNU
Textutils</a>.  Windows users can get binary md5 programs from <a
href="http://www.fourmilab.ch/md5/">here</a>, <a
href="http://www.pc-tools.net/win32/freeware/console/">here</a>, or
<a href="http://www.slavasoft.com/fsum/">here</a>.</p>

<p>We strongly recommend that you verify your downloads with both PGP and MD5.</p>
