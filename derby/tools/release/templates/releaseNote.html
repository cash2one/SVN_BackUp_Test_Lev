  TEMPLATE FOR CREATING A RELEASE NOTE FOR A SIGNIFICANT JIRA ENTRY

  This is a standard form for filling in a release note for a
  significant issue logged in JIRA. This could be an issue
  which introduces a new feature. Or it could be an issue
  which changes Derby in a way which breaks existing
  applications. By using this standard form, you help the
  release manager generate documentation for the next
  release.

  When you are done filling in this form, attach it to the appropriate
  JIRA as "releaseNote.html". You can improve your release note as
  many times as you like. The release machinery will simply use the
  last version of releaseNote.html attached to the JIRA.

  This template has the following standard sections. Brackets mark
  optional sections.

  Summary of Change
  Symptoms Seen by Applications Affected by Change
  [ Incompatibilities with Previous Release ]
  Rationale for Change
  [ Application Changes Required ]

  Go through this template and replace all instances of "????" with
  appropriate text. Remove the optional sections if you don't need them.

<!-- 
  SUMMARIZE THE ISSUE. This is a one line, one sentence summary of the
  issue. It serves as the title for the issue in the Issues section of
  the full Release Notes.

  For instance:

  Applications may no longer open two InputStreams on the same ResultSet column.

<h4>Summary of Change</h4>

????

<!-- 
  DESCRIBE WHAT IT IS THAT THE USER ACTUALLY SEES WHEN THE PROBLEM OCCURS.

  For instance:

  In the previous release, applications were able to open two
  InputStreams on the same column. Depending on how these streams
  interacted, the value siphoned out of the column was erratic. Now
  Derby raises a SQLException when the application attempts to create
  the second InputStream.

<!-- 
  OPTIONAL: DESCRIBE INCOMPATIBILITIES WITH PREVIOUS RELEASE, IF ANY.

  For instance:

  Applications which open two InputStreams on the ResultSet column now
  fail.

<h4>Incompatibilities with Previous Release</h4>
<p>
????

<!-- 
  DESCRIBE WHY THE CHANGE WAS MADE.

  For instance:

  The previous behavior violated the JDBC standard. The new behavior
  is correct.
-->

<h4>Rationale for Change</h4>

????
</p>


<!-- 
  OPTIONAL: DESCRIBE HOW TO REVERT TO THE PREVIOUS BEHAVIOR OR
  OTHERWISE AVOID THE INCOMPATIBILITIES INTRODUCED BY THIS CHANGE.

  For instance:

  Users must recode applications which open multiple streams on the same column.
