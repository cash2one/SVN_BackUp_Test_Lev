This directory contains a java program that can be used to flag possible
problems in the translation of the localized message files.
This program can be run at any time, for instance, to identify where
the localized files are lagging behind their English counterparts.
But, it is anticipated to be run before a check-in of changes to one of
the localization files, or before a release.

It is intended to be run on the source of the messages; as such, there is
no point in including this into any runtime jar file.

The output of the program requires manual perusal, because many aspects 
checked may be acceptable in a particular language, or translation, or for
a specific message. As such, it is not part of the full build.

Files in this directory
=======================
LocCompare.java
  This file is the source code used to generate a test class for
  translated messages.

  This file will build the class into the svnroot/classes directory

Syntax
======
java [-Dderbysvntop=<svntop>] [-Dtranslations=<newloc>] LocCompare [<territories>][?|-h]
 where 
   svntop      = top of derby svn tree for branch or trunk
                 default is current dir is the top
   newloc      = temporary location for translated files 
                 drda locale files are expected in a subdir 'drda'
                 default is same file structure as for the english files
   territories = one translated territories, or 'all' 
                 where all means: 
                    {cs,de_DE,es,fr,hu,it,ja_JP,ko_KR,pl,pt_BR,ru,zh_CN,zh_TW}
   ?|-h        = you can pass on -h or ? to get this message
   you can also pass -Dtvtdebug=true in to see more comments.

Examples:
--------------------
compares french:
  java -Dderbysvntop=c:/derby/trunk LocCompare fr 
compares unexisting french french:
  java -Dderbysvntop=c:/derby/trunk LocCompare fr
compares all territories listed in program:
  java -Dderbysvntop=c:/derby/trunk LocCompare 
compares all territories listed in program in 'chatty' mode:
  java -Dtvtdebug=true -Dderbysvntop=c:/derby/trunk LocCompare 
gets usage message
  java LocCompare -h
--------------------

Files accessed by the program
=============================
always: English:
 svnroot/java/engine/org/apache/derby/loc/messages_en.properties
 svnroot/java/tools/org/apache/derby/loc/toolsmessages.properties
 svnroot/java/tools/org/apache/derby/loc/sysinfoMessages.properties
 svnroot/java/drda/org/apache/derby/loc/drda/messages_en.properties
 svnroot/java/drda/org/apache/derby/loc/drda/servlet_messages.properties

translated files in the following languages:
  cs	- Czech
  de_DE  - German
  es	- Spanish
  fr	- French
  hu	- Hungarian
  it	- Italian
  ja_JP  - Japanese
  ko_KR	- Korean
  pl	- Polish
  pt_BR	- Portuguese
  ru	- Russian
  zh_CN	- Chinese
  zh_TW	- Traditional Chinese

 By default, the translated files are expected to be in the same location
 as the English files indicated above, i.e. for German engine messages the
 file is expected to be:
 svnroot/java/engine/org/apache/derby/loc/messages_de_DE.properties

 (For convenience, it is also possible to specify a temporary location, using
  the -Dtranslations= property. In this case, it is necessary to place 
  the network server files in a subdirectory because the main file server file
  has the same name as the engine messages file.)


Details about the program
=========================
The program has two modes, a 'chatty' mode, which shows a lot of information,
and a normal mode, which only flags possible problems and Failures.
The chatty mode is initialized by specifying the property -Dtvtdebug=true.
In the chatty mode, every message string in the English message files is 
printed out with - if existing - its localized counterpart. 
In the normal mode, only messages that have been identified with a possible
problem will be printed.

The messages are printed with a < for English, and > for the localization:

	 WARNING - found single single quotes - quotes need to be doubled

  ===============
--------------------

The program will flag the following problems:
- missing file
- missing message
- message containing characters outside the range 0x00-0x1f (which are ASCII) and 0x7f-0xff - message requiring double quotes but having only one
- message not having same number of parameters as English
- unmatched curly braces ('{' and '}')
- unmatched number of uppercased strings 
and warn about the following:
- if the number of the following characters in the translated message is 
  different from the English:
	'%', ';', ':', '_', '=', '(', ')', '+', '/', '[', ']', '\'
- if the strings or parameters, or their sequence within curly braces is different
- for file toolsmessages*.properties, if there are double single quotes in a string
  without replacements 
- if there are single quotes where they should be doubled up
- different uppercased strings 

In addition, the chatty mode will describe successful comparisons.
