FireTrace Extension for Firefox
===============================

This extension adds JavaScript execution tracing capabilities to Firefox, the purpose being to compare
Firefox and HtmlUnit traces, in order to easily determine if and when the traces diverge, making it easier
to find (and fix) bugs in HtmlUnit.

After installing this extension (see below), you will have three new buttons available to add to your toolbar
(View -> Toolbars -> Customize) to drag and drop:
  1. Enable/Disable Tracing
  2. Save Trace Log to File
  3. Clear Trace Log

Most of the logic for this extension is in the ./content/overlay.js file.

This extension was generated by the Extension Wizard (http://ted.mielczarek.org/code/mozilla/extensionwiz).
This extension is compatible only with Firefox 1.5 and above.
Most of the files in this package are based on the 'helloworld' extension from the Mozillazine Knowledge Base.

You can build an XPI for installation by running the build.sh script located in this folder.

Development installation instructions:
  1. Put the full path to this folder (e.g. c:\dev\firetrace on Windows, /home/user/dev/firetrace on Unix-like) in
     a file named firetrace@daniel.gredler and copy that file to [your Firefox profile folder]\extensions\
  2. Restart Firefox.

TODO Items
==========

1. Trace DOM calls: The debugger API exposed by Firefox allows us to trace non-DOM calls, but DOM calls are
   harder. A first attempt has been made with the hookDomCalls() method, but it's not complete, and can very
   likely be improved upon.

2. Align the trace formats output by this extension and the HtmlUnit debugger, so that a quick diff can be
   used to easily determine the point of departure between the two traces.
