      # Allows you to consider additional controller-wide information when generating an ETag.
      # For example, if you serve pages tailored depending on who's logged in at the moment, you
      # may want to add the current user id to be part of the ETag to prevent unauthorized displaying
      # of cached pages.
      #

    # Sets the +etag+, +last_modified+, or both on the response and renders a
    # <tt>304 Not Modified</tt> response if the request is already fresh.
    #
    # === Parameters:
    #
    # * <tt>:etag</tt>.
    # * <tt>:last_modified</tt>.
    # * <tt>:public</tt> By default the Cache-Control header is private, set this to
    #   +true+ if you want your application to be cacheable by other devices (proxy caches).
    # * <tt>:template</tt> By default, the template digest for the current
    #   controller/action is included in ETags. If the action renders a
    #   different template, you can include its digest instead. If the action
    #   doesn't render a template at all, you can pass <tt>template: false</tt>
    #   to skip any attempt to check for a template digest.
    #
    # === Example:
    #
    #   def show
    #     @article = Article.find(params[:id])
    #     fresh_when(etag: @article, last_modified: @article.updated_at, public: true)
    #   end
    #
    # This will render the show template if the request isn't sending a matching ETag or
    # If-Modified-Since header and just a <tt>304 Not Modified</tt> response if there's a match.
    #
    # You can also just pass a record. In this case +last_modified+ will be set
    # by calling +updated_at+ and +etag+ by passing the object itself.
    #
    #   def show
    #     @article = Article.find(params[:id])
    #     fresh_when(@article)
    #   end
    #
    # You can also pass an object that responds to +maximum+, such as a
    # collection of active records. In this case +last_modified+ will be set by
    # calling +maximum(:updated_at)+ on the collection (the timestamp of the
    # most recently updated record) and the +etag+ by passing the object itself.
    #
    #   def index
    #     @articles = Article.all
    #     fresh_when(@articles)
    #   end
    #
    # When passing a record or a collection, you can still set the public header:
    #
    #   def show
    #     @article = Article.find(params[:id])
    #     fresh_when(@article, public: true)
    #   end
    #
    # When rendering a different template than the default controller/action
    # style, you can indicate which digest to include in the ETag:
    #
    #   before_action { fresh_when @article, template: 'widgets/show' }
    #
    def fresh_when(object = nil, etag: object, last_modified: nil, public: false, template: nil)

    # the client request. If the request doesn't match the options provided, the
    # request is considered stale and should be generated from scratch. Otherwise,
    # it's fresh and we don't need to generate anything and a reply of <tt>304 Not Modified</tt> is sent.

    # === Parameters:

    # * <tt>:last_modified</tt>.
    # * <tt>:public</tt> By default the Cache-Control header is private, set this to
    #   +true+ if you want your application to be cacheable by other devices (proxy caches).
    # * <tt>:template</tt> By default, the template digest for the current
    #   controller/action is included in ETags. If the action renders a
    #   different template, you can include its digest instead. If the action
    #   doesn't render a template at all, you can pass <tt>template: false</tt>
