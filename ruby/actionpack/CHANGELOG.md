*   Update `ActionController::TestSession#fetch` to behave more like
    `ActionDispatch::Request::Session#fetch` when using non-string keys.

    *Jeremy Friesen*

*   Using strings or symbols for middleware class names is deprecated.  Convert
    things like this:

      middleware.use "Foo::Bar"

    to this:

      middleware.use Foo::Bar

*   ActionController::TestSession now accepts a default value as well as
    a block for generating a default value based off the key provided.

    This fixes calls to session#fetch in ApplicationController instances that
    take more two arguments or a block from raising `ArgumentError: wrong
    number of arguments (2 for 1)` when performing controller tests.

    *Matthew Gerrior*

*   Fix `ActionController::Parameters#fetch` overwriting `KeyError` returned by
    default block.

    *Jonas Schuber Erlandsson*, *Roque Pinel*

*   `ActionController::Parameters` no longer inherits from
    `HashWithIndifferentAccess`

    Inheriting from `HashWithIndifferentAccess` allowed users to call any
    enumerable methods on `Parameters` object, resulting in a risk of losing the
    `permitted?` status or even getting back a pure `Hash` object instead of
    a `Parameters` object with proper sanitization.

    By not inheriting from `HashWithIndifferentAccess`, we are able to make
    sure that all methods that are defined in `Parameters` object will return
    a proper `Parameters` object with a correct `permitted?` flag.

    *Prem Sichanugrist*

*   Replaced `ActiveSupport::Concurrency::Latch` with `Concurrent::CountDownLatch`
    from the concurrent-ruby gem.

    *Jerry D'Antonio*

*   Add ability to filter parameters based on parent keys.

        # matches {credit_card: {code: "xxxx"}}
        # doesn't match {file: { code: "xxxx"}}
        config.filter_parameters += [ "credit_card.code" ]

    See #13897.

    *Guillaume Malette*

*   Deprecate passing first parameter as `Hash` and default status code for `head` method.

    *Mehmet Emin İNAÇ*

*   Adds`Rack::Utils::ParameterTypeError` and `Rack::Utils::InvalidParameterError`
    to the rescue_responses hash in `ExceptionWrapper` (Rack recommends
    integrators serve 400s for both of these).

    *Grey Baker*

*   Add support for API only apps.
    ActionController::API is added as a replacement of
    ActionController::Base for this kind of applications.

    *Santiago Pastorino & Jorge Bejar*

*   Remove `assigns` and `assert_template`. Both methods have been extracted
    into a gem at https://github.com/rails/rails-controller-testing.

    See #18950.

    *Alan Guo Xiang Tan*

*   `FileHandler` and `Static` middleware initializers accept `index` argument
    to configure the directory index file name. Defaults to `index` (as in
    `index.html`).

    See #20017.

    *Eliot Sykes*

*   Deprecate `:nothing` option for `render` method.

    *Mehmet Emin İNAÇ*

*   Fix `rake routes` not showing the right format when
    nesting multiple routes.

    See #18373.

    *Ravil Bayramgalin*

*   Add ability to override default form builder for a controller.

        class AdminController < ApplicationController
          default_form_builder AdminFormBuilder
        end

    *Kevin McPhillips*

*   For actions with no corresponding templates, render `head :no_content`
    instead of raising an error. This allows for slimmer API controller
    methods that simply work, without needing further instructions.

    See #19036.

    *Stephen Bussey*

*   Provide friendlier access to request variants.

        request.variant = :phone
        request.variant.phone?  # true
        request.variant.tablet? # false

        request.variant = [:phone, :tablet]
        request.variant.phone?                  # true
        request.variant.desktop?                # false
        request.variant.any?(:phone, :desktop)  # true
        request.variant.any?(:desktop, :watch)  # false

    *George Claghorn*

*   Fix regression where a gzip file response would have a Content-type,
    even when it was a 304 status code.

    See #19271.

    *Kohei Suzuki*

*   Fix handling of empty `X_FORWARDED_HOST` header in `raw_host_with_port`.

    Previously, an empty `X_FORWARDED_HOST` header would cause
    `Actiondispatch::Http:URL.raw_host_with_port` to return `nil`, causing
    `Actiondispatch::Http:URL.host` to raise a `NoMethodError`.

    *Adam Forsyth*

*   Allow `Bearer` as token-keyword in `Authorization-Header`.

    Aditionally to `Token`, the keyword `Bearer` is acceptable as a keyword
    for the auth-token. The `Bearer` keyword is described in the original
    OAuth RFC and used in libraries like Angular-JWT.

    See #19094.

    *Peter Schröder*

*   Drop request class from RouteSet constructor.

    If you would like to use a custom request class, please subclass and implement
    the `request_class` method.

    *tenderlove@ruby-lang.org*

*   Fallback to `ENV['RAILS_RELATIVE_URL_ROOT']` in `url_for`.

    Fixed an issue where the `RAILS_RELATIVE_URL_ROOT` environment variable is not
    prepended to the path when `url_for` is called. If `SCRIPT_NAME` (used by Rack)
    is set, it takes precedence.

    Fixes #5122.

    *Yasyf Mohamedali*

*   Partitioning of routes is now done when the routes are being drawn. This
    helps to decrease the time spent filtering the routes during the first request.

    *Guo Xiang Tan*

*   Fix regression in functional tests. Responses should have default headers
    assigned.

    See #18423.

    *Jeremy Kemper*, *Yves Senn*

*   Deprecate AbstractController#skip_action_callback in favor of individual skip_callback methods
    (which can be made to raise an error if no callback was removed).

    *Iain Beeston*

*   Alias the `ActionDispatch::Request#uuid` method to `ActionDispatch::Request#request_id`.
    Due to implementation, `config.log_tags = [:request_id]` also works in substitute
    for `config.log_tags = [:uuid]`.

    *David Ilizarov*

*   Change filter on /rails/info/routes to use an actual path regexp from rails
    and not approximate javascript version. Oniguruma supports much more
    extensive list of features than javascript regexp engine.

    Fixes #18402.

    *Ravil Bayramgalin*

*   Non-string authenticity tokens do not raise NoMethodError when decoding
    the masked token.

    *Ville Lautanala*

*   Add `http_cache_forever` to Action Controller, so we can cache a response
    that never gets expired.

    *arthurnn*

*   `ActionController#translate` supports symbols as shortcuts.
    When a shortcut is given it also performs the lookup without the action
    name.

    *Max Melentiev*

*   Expand `ActionController::ConditionalGet#fresh_when` and `stale?` to also
    accept a collection of records as the first argument, so that the
    following code can be written in a shorter form.

        # Before
        def index
          @articles = Article.all
          fresh_when(etag: @articles, last_modified: @articles.maximum(:updated_at))
        end

        # After
        def index
          @articles = Article.all
          fresh_when(@articles)
        end

    *claudiob*

*   Explicitly ignored wildcard verbs when searching for HEAD routes before fallback

    Fixes an issue where a mounted rack app at root would intercept the HEAD
    request causing an incorrect behavior during the fall back to GET requests.

    Example:

        draw do
            get '/home' => 'test#index'
            mount rack_app, at: '/'
        end
        head '/home'
        assert_response :success

    In this case, a HEAD request runs through the routes the first time and fails
    to match anything. Then, it runs through the list with the fallback and matches
    `get '/home'`. The original behavior would match the rack app in the first pass.

    *Terence Sun*

*   Migrating xhr methods to keyword arguments syntax
    in `ActionController::TestCase` and `ActionDispatch::Integration`

    Old syntax:

        xhr :get, :create, params: { id: 1 }

    New syntax example:

        get :create, params: { id: 1 }, xhr: true

    *Kir Shatrov*

*   Migrating to keyword arguments syntax in `ActionController::TestCase` and
    `ActionDispatch::Integration` HTTP request methods.

    Example:

        post :create, params: { y: x }, session: { a: 'b' }
        get :view, params: { id: 1 }
        get :view, params: { id: 1 }, format: :json

    *Kir Shatrov*

*   Preserve default url options when generating URLs.

    Fixes an issue that would cause `default_url_options` to be lost when
    generating URLs with fewer positional arguments than parameters in the
    route definition.

    *Tekin Suleyman*

*   Deprecate `*_via_redirect` integration test methods.

    Use `follow_redirect!` manually after the request call for the same behavior.

    *Aditya Kapoor*

*   Add `ActionController::Renderer` to render arbitrary templates
    outside controller actions.

    Its functionality is accessible through class methods `render` and
    `renderer` of `ActionController::Base`.

    *Ravil Bayramgalin*

*   Support `:assigns` option when rendering with controllers/mailers.

    *Ravil Bayramgalin*

*   Default headers, removed in controller actions, are no longer reapplied on
    the test response.

    *Jonas Baumann*

*   Deprecate all `*_filter` callbacks in favor of `*_action` callbacks.

    *Rafael Mendonça França*

*   Allow you to pass `prepend: false` to `protect_from_forgery` to have the
    verification callback appended instead of prepended to the chain.
    This allows you to let the verification step depend on prior callbacks.

    Example:

        class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
          before_action :authenticate
          protect_from_forgery prepend: false, unless: -> { @authenticated_by.oauth? }

          private
            def authenticate
              if oauth_request?
                # authenticate with oauth
                @authenticated_by = 'oauth'.inquiry
              else
                # authenticate with cookies
                @authenticated_by = 'cookie'.inquiry
              end
            end
        end

    *Josef Šimánek*

*   Remove `ActionController::HideActions`.

    *Ravil Bayramgalin*

*   Remove `respond_to`/`respond_with` placeholder methods, this functionality
    has been extracted to the `responders` gem.

    *Carlos Antonio da Silva*

*   Remove deprecated assertion files.

    *Rafael Mendonça França*

*   Remove deprecated usage of string keys in URL helpers.

    *Rafael Mendonça França*

*   Remove deprecated `only_path` option on `*_path` helpers.

    *Rafael Mendonça França*

*   Remove deprecated `NamedRouteCollection#helpers`.

    *Rafael Mendonça França*

*   Remove deprecated support to define routes with `:to` option that doesn't contain `#`.

    *Rafael Mendonça França*

*   Remove deprecated `ActionDispatch::Response#to_ary`.

    *Rafael Mendonça França*

*   Remove deprecated `ActionDispatch::Request#deep_munge`.

    *Rafael Mendonça França*

*   Remove deprecated `ActionDispatch::Http::Parameters#symbolized_path_parameters`.

    *Rafael Mendonça França*

*   Remove deprecated option `use_route` in controller tests.

    *Rafael Mendonça França*

*   Ensure `append_info_to_payload` is called even if an exception is raised.

    Fixes an issue where when an exception is raised in the request the additional
    payload data is not available.

    See:
    * #14903
    * https://github.com/roidrage/lograge/issues/37

    *Dieter Komendera*, *Margus Pärt*

*   Correctly rely on the response's status code to handle calls to `head`.

    *Robin Dupret*

*   Using `head` method returns empty response_body instead
    of returning a single space " ".

    The old behavior was added as a workaround for a bug in an early
    version of Safari, where the HTTP headers are not returned correctly
    if the response body has a 0-length. This is been fixed since and
    the workaround is no longer necessary.

    Fixes #18253.

    *Prathamesh Sonpatki*

*   Fix how polymorphic routes works with objects that implement `to_model`.

    *Travis Grathwell*

*   Stop converting empty arrays in `params` to `nil`.

    This behavior was introduced in response to CVE-2012-2660, CVE-2012-2694
    and CVE-2013-0155

    ActiveRecord now issues a safe query when passing an empty array into
    a where clause, so there is no longer a need to defend against this type
    of input (any nils are still stripped from the array).

    *Chris Sinjakli*

*   Fixed usage of optional scopes in url helpers.

    *Alex Robbin*

*   Fixed handling of positional url helper arguments when `format: false`.

    Fixes #17819.

    *Andrew White*, *Tatiana Soukiassian*
