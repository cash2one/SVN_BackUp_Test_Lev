  # == Active Job Async Job
  #
  # When enqueueing jobs with Async Job each job will be executed asynchronously
  # on a +concurrent-ruby+ thread pool. All job data is retained in memory.
  # Because job data is not saved to a persistent datastore there is no
  # additional infrastructure needed and jobs process quickly. The lack of
  # persistence, however, means that all unprocessed jobs will be lost on
  # application restart. Therefore in-memory queue adapters are unsuitable for
  # most production environments but are excellent for development and testing.
  #
  # Read more about Concurrent Ruby {here}[https://github.com/ruby-concurrency/concurrent-ruby].
  #
  # To use Async Job set the queue_adapter config to +:async+.
  #
  #   Rails.application.config.active_job.queue_adapter = :async
  #
  # Async Job supports job queues specified with +queue_as+. Queues are created
  # automatically as needed and each has its own thread pool.
