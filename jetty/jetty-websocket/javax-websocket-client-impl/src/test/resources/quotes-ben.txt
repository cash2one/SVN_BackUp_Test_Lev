a|Benjamin Franklin
q|There never was a good war or a bad peace.
q|We must, indeed, all hang together, or assuredly we shall all hang separately.
q|Our new Constitution is now established, and has an appearance that promises permanency; but in this world nothing can be said to be certain, except death and taxes.
