/** Build a request to be pushed.
 * <p>
 * A PushBuilder is obtained by calling {@link Request#getPushBuilder()}
 * which creates an initializes the builder as follows:
 * <ul>
 * <li> Each call to getPushBuilder() will return a new instance of a 
 * PushBuilder based off the Request.  Any mutations to the
 * returned PushBuilder are not reflected on future returns.</li>
 * <li>The method is initialized to "GET"</li>
 * <li>The requests headers are added to the Builder, except for:<ul>
 *   <li>Conditional headers (eg. If-Modified-Since)
 *   <li>Range headers
 *   <li>Expect headers
 *   <li>Authorization headers
 *   <li>Referrer headers
 * </ul></li>
 * <li>If the request was Authenticated, an Authorization header will 
 * be set with a container generated token that will result in equivalent
 * Authorization for the pushed request</li>
 * <li>The query string from {@link HttpServletRequest#getQueryString()}
 * <li>The {@link HttpServletRequest#getRequestedSessionId()} value, unless at the time
 * of the call {@link HttpServletRequest#getSession(boolean)}
 * has previously been called to create a new {@link HttpSession}, in 
 * which case the new session ID will be used as the PushBuilders 
 * requested session ID. The source of the requested session id will be the 
 * same as for the request</li>
 * <li>The Referer header will be set to {@link HttpServletRequest#getRequestURL()} 
 * plus any {@link HttpServletRequest#getQueryString()} </li>
 * <li>If {@link HttpServletResponse#addCookie(Cookie)} has been called
 * on the associated response, then a corresponding Cookie header will be added
 * to the PushBuilder, unless the {@link Cookie#getMaxAge()} is &lt;=0, in which
 * case the Cookie will be removed from the builder.</li>
 * <li>If this request has has the conditional headers If-Modified-Since or
 * If-None-Match then the {@link #isConditional()} header is set to true.</li> 
 * </ul>
 * <p>A PushBuilder can be customized by chained calls to mutator methods before the 
 * {@link #push()} method is called to initiate a push request with the current state
 * of the builder.  After the call to {@link #push()}, the builder may be reused for
 * another push, however the {@link #path(String)}, {@link #etag(String)} and
 * {@link #lastModified(String)} values will have been nulled.  All other 
 * values are retained over calls to {@link #push()}.
