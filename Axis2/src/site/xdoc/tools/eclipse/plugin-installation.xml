        <h1>Eclipse plugin installation</h1>
        <section name="Introduction">
            <p>
                This document provides instructions for installating of the two Eclipse plugins provided by Axis2
                (<a href="servicearchiver-plugin.html">Service Archive Generator</a> and
                <a href="wsdl2java-plugin.html">Code Generator Wizard</a>).
                The two plugins should work on Eclipse version 3.1 and upwards, and require at least Java 1.5.
                The plugins have dependencies on bundles that are installed by default in the Eclipse IDE for Java EE Developers
                edition, but not in the Eclipse IDE for Java Developers edition. It is therefore recommended
                to use the EE edition.
                The installation procedure is the same for both plugins, but depends on the Eclipse
                version being used. To determine which procedure to use, check if there is a
                <tt>dropins</tt> folder in the Eclipse installation directory. This folder is used
                by the p2 provisioning system introduced in recent Eclipse version. It should be
                present starting with Eclipse version 3.4.
            </p>
        </section>
        <section name="Installation using the dropins directory">
            <p>
                If your Eclipse version uses p2, use the following procedure to install the
                Axis2 plugins:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li><a href="../index.html">Download</a> the ZIP file for the plugin you want to install.</li>
                <li>Extract the content of the <tt>plugins</tt> folder in the ZIP archive into the
                <tt>dropins</tt> folder (i.e. do <b>not</b> create a <tt>plugins</tt> folder under <tt>dropins</tt>).</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                As explained <a href="http://wiki.eclipse.org/Equinox_p2_Getting_Started#Dropins">here</a>,
                it is possible to use other directory layouts in the <tt>dropins</tt> folder.
            </p>
        </section>
        <section name="Installation on older Eclipse versions">
            <p>
                If you have an older Eclipse version that doesn't support p2 yet, use the following
                procedure to install the Axis2 plugins:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li><a href="../index.html">Download</a> the ZIP file for the plugin you want to install.</li>
                <li>Extract the content of the ZIP archive into the Eclipse installation directory.
                This should add one or more JAR files and/or directories to the existing <tt>plugins</tt>
                folder.</li>
            </ol>
        </section>
    </body>
</document>
