This directory includes the CXF jar, the CXF manifest jar, the required
dependencies, and many optional dependencies. The "modules" directory
contains the cxf.jar split up into smaller pieces if you wish to use only
specific parts of CXF.

The 'manifest jar' is a jar containing only a MANIFEST.MF with a classpath
that calls in all the other jar.

Jars marked with a [7] at the end are optional for Java 7 as the 
functionality provided by those jars are provided in the JDK.

The following jars are required for all CXF usage:
- cxf-core.jar
- geronimo-javamail.jar (Or the Sun equivalent) [7]
  (MAY be able to remove javamail if you don't use any MIME/MTOM/SAAJ type things)
- jaxb-api.jar  [7]
- jaxb-core.jar  [7]
- jaxb-impl.jar (this is a [7] for normal runtime, but is required for 
                 tooling and the dynamic clients)
- xmlschema-core.jar
- woodstox-core-asl.jar
- stax2-api.jar
- slf4j-*.jar
- jcl-over-slf4j.jar

Note: woodstox and stax2-api can be removed if you set the 
"org.apache.cxf.stax.allowInsecureParser‚Äù system property to true.  This
is NOT recommended as it opens up various DOS attacks.
