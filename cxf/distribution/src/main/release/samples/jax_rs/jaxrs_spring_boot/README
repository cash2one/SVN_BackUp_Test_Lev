== Spring Boot - Samples - CXF Rest Web Services 

This sample project demonstrates how to use http://projects.spring.io/spring-rs-cxf/[CXF Rest Web Services]
with Spring Boot. 

The sample uses Maven. It can be built and run from the command line:

----
$ mvn spring-boot:run
----

http://localhost:8080/services/helloservice/sayHello/ApacheCxfUser will now display the output in the browser
like "Hello ApacheCxfUser, Welcome to CXF RS Spring Boot World!!!"

To run the client from a command line open a new terminal window and run:

----
$ mvn exec:java
----
