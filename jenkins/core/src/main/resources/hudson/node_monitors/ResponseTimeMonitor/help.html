    This monitors the round trip network response time from the master to the slave, and if it
    goes above a threshold repeatedly, it marks the slave offline.

    <p>
    This is useful for detecting unresponsive slaves, or other network problems that clog the
    communication channel. More specifically, the master sends a no-op command to the slave,
    and checks the time it takes to get back the result of this no-op command.
