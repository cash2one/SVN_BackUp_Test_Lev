  A slave needs to have a directory dedicated to Jenkins. Specify
  the  path of this work directory on the slave. It is best to use
  an absolute path, such as '/var/jenkins' or 'c:\jenkins'. This
  should be a path local to the slave machine. There's no need for
  this path to be visible from the master, under normal circumstances.

  <p>
  Slaves do not maintain important data (other than active workspaces
  of projects last built on it), so you can possibly set the slave
  workspace to a temporary directory. The only downside of doing this
  is that you may lose the up-to-date workspace if the slave is turned off.

  <p>
  If you use a relative path, such as './jenkins-slave', the path will
  be relative to the current working directory that the launcher provides.
  <ul>
  <li>For launchers where Jenkins controls starting the slave process, such
  as SSH, the current working directory will typically be consistent,
  <i>e.g.</i> the user's home directory. This means that Jenkins will be able to
  rely on the caching of tool installations and workspaces from previous
  builds.
  </li>
  <li>For launchers where Jenkins has no control over starting the slave
  process, such as JNLP when launched from either the command line or via
  a web browser link, the current working directory may change between
  launches of the slave and use of a relative path may prove problematic.
  The principal issue encountered when using relative paths with launchers
  like JNLP is the proliferation of stale workspaces and tool installation
  on the slave machine. This can cause disk space issues.
  <i>Note: there are some cloud providers that specifically use relative
  paths with the JNLP launcher to allow for dynamically provisioned pools
  of semi-heterogeneous slaves.</i></li>
  </ul>
