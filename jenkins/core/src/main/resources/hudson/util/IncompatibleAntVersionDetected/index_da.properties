errorMessage=Din servlet container indl\u00e6ser en \u00e6ldre version af Ant, hvilket forhindrer Jenkins \
i at indl\u00e6se sin egen nyere Ant version. \ (Ant klasser indl\u00e6ses fra {0}) <br> \
M\u00e5ske kan du tilsides\u00e6tte Antversionen i din container ved at kopiere Ant fra Jenkins''s <tt>WEB-INF/lib</tt>, \
eller du kan eventuelt s\u00e6tte classloader delegation til child-first, s\u00e5 Jenkins ser sin egen kopi f\u00f8rst?
Error=Fejl
