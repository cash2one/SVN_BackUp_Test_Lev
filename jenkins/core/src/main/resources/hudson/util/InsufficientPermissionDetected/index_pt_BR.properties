# We detected that Jenkins does not have sufficient permission to run, \ 
# as indicated by the stack trace below. Most likely cause of this  \ 
# problem is that the security manger is on. If that was intended, \ 
# you need to grant sufficient permissions for Jenkins to run. Otherwise, \ 
# or if you have no idea what a security manager is, then the easiest \ 
# way to fix the problem is simply to turn the security manager off.
errorMessage.1=N\u00f3s detectamos que o Jenkins n\u00e3 tem permiss\u00f5es suficiente para executar. \
como indicado pela informa\u00e7\u00e3o abaixo. Normalmente a causa desse problema \
est\u00e1 no gerenciador de seguran\u00e7a. Se voc\u00ea n\u00e3o sabe como configurar o gerenciador \	
de seguran\u00e7a, poder\u00e1 desativ\u00e1-lo.
