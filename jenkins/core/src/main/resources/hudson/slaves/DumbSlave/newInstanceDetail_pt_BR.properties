# Adds a plain, dumb slave to Jenkins. This is called "dumb" because Jenkins doesn''t provide \
# higher level of integration with these slaves, such as dynamic provisioning. \
# Select this type if no other slave types apply &mdash; for example such as when you are adding \
# a physical computer, virtual machines managed outside Jenkins, etc.
detail=Adiciona um slave simples e burro ao Jenkins. \u00c9 chamado "burro" porque o Jenkins n\u00e3o prov\u00ea um maior n\u00edvel de integra\u00e7\u00e3o com estes slaves, como um provisionamento din\u00e2mico. Selecione este tipo se nenhum outro slave se aplica; por exemplo como quando voc\u00ea est\u00e1 adicionando um computador f\u00edsico, m\u00e1quinas virtuais gerenci\u00e1veis fora do Jenkins, etc.
