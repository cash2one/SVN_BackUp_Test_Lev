detail=Tilf\u00f8jer en almindelig dum slave til Jenkins. Disse slaver kaldes ''dumme'' da Jenkins ikke \
tilbyder et h\u00f8jere niveau af kontrol over disse slaver, s\u00e5som dynamisk provisionering. \
V\u00e6lg denne type hvis ingen anden slavetype passer &mdash; for eksempel hvis du \
tilf\u00f8jer en fysisk computer/ virtuel maskine bestyret udenfor Jenkins, mv.
