blurb=Starter en slave via et agentprogram gennem <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Web_Start">JNLP</a>. \
Slave opstarten bliver i dette tilf\u00e6lde initieret af slaven, \
s\u00e5ledes beh\u00f8ver slaven i dette tilf\u00e6lde ikke at v\u00e6re IP tilg\u00e6ngelig fra master''en (f.eks. bag en firewall.) \
Det er ogs\u00e5 her muligt at starte slaven uden GUI, for eksempel som en Windows service.
