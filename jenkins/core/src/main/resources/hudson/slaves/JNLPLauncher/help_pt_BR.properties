# Starts a slave by launching an agent program through <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Web_Start">JNLP</a>. \
# The launch in this case is initiated by the slave, \
# thus slaves need not be IP reachable from the master (e.g. behind the firewall.) \
# It is still possible to start a launch without GUI, for example as a Windows service.
