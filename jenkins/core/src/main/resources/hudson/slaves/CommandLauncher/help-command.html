  Command to be used to launch a slave agent program, which controls the slave
  computer and communicates with the master. Jenkins assumes that
  the executed program launches the <tt>slave.jar</tt> program on the correct
  slave machine.

  <p>
  A copy of <tt>slave.jar</tt> can be downloaded from <a href="${rootURL}/jnlpJars/slave.jar"><tt>here</tt></a>.

  <p>
  In a simple case, this could be
  something like "ssh <i>hostname</i> java -jar ~/bin/slave.jar".

  However, it is often a good idea to write a small shell script, like the following, on a slave
  so that you can control the location of Java and/or slave.jar, as well as set up any
  environment variables specific to this slave node, such as PATH.

<pre>
#!/bin/sh
exec java -jar ~/bin/slave.jar
</pre>

  <p>
  You can use any command to run a process on the slave machine, such as RSH,
  as long as stdin/stdout of this process will be connected to
  "java -jar ~/bin/slave.jar" eventually.

  <p>
  In a larger deployment, it is also worth considering to load <tt>slave.jar</tt> from
  a NFS-mounted common location, so that you don't have to update this file every time
  you update Jenkins.

  <p>
  Setting this to "ssh -v <i>hostname</i>" may be useful for debugging connectivity
  issue.
