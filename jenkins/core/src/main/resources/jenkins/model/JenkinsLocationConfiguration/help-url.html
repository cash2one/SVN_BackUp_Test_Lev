<div>
  Optionally specify the HTTP address of the Jenkins installation, such
  as <tt>http://yourhost.yourdomain/jenkins/</tt>. This value is used to
  let Jenkins know how to refer to itself, ie. to display images or to
  create links in emails.

  <p>
  This is necessary because Jenkins cannot reliably detect such a URL
  from within itself.
