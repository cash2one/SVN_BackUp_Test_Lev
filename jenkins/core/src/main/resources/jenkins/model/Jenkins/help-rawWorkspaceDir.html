<div>
    Specify where Jenkins would store job workspaces on the master node.
    (It has no effect on builds run on slaves.)
    This value can include the following variables.

    <ul>
        <li><tt>${JENKINS_HOME}</tt> &mdash; Jenkins home directory.
        <li><tt>${ITEM_ROOTDIR}</tt> &mdash; Root directory of a job for which the default workspace is allocated.
        <li><tt>${ITEM_FULL_NAME}</tt> &mdash; '/'-separated job name, like "foo/bar".
    </ul>

    <p>
    Changing this value allows you to put workspaces on SSD, SCSI, or even ram disks.
    Default value is <tt>${ITEM_ROOTDIR}/workspace</tt>.
