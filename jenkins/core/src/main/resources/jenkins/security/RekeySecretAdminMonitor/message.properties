pleaseRekeyAsap=\
    Because of <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/SECURITY/Jenkins+Security+Advisory+2013-01-04">a security vulnerability</a> discovered earlier, we need to \
    change the encryption key used to protect secrets in your configuration files on the disk. \
    This process scans a large portion of your <tt>$JENKINS_HOME</tt> ({0}), \
    find encrypted data, re-key them, which will take some time. \
    See <a href="http://jenkins-ci.org/rekey">this document</a> for more implications about different ways of doing this \
    (or not doing this.) This operation can be safely run in background, but cautious users \
    are recommended to take backups.

rekeyInProgress=Re-keying is in progress. <a href="{0}/log">You can check the log</a>.

rekeySuccessful=\
  Secrets in your <tt>$JENKINS_HOME</tt> has been re-keyed successfully. \
  <a href="{0}/log">Please check the log</a>, confirm the success, and then dismiss or re-run.

rekeyHadProblems=\
  Re-keying has completed, but there were problems. <a href="{0}">Please check the log</a>.
