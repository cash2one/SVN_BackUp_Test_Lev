    This API token can be used for authenticating yourself in the REST API call.
    See <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Remote+access+API">our wiki</a> for more details.
    The API token should be protected like your password, as it allows other people to access Jenkins as you.
