    Creates a small button that lets the user copies a text into clipboard

    <st:attribute name="tooltip">
      Tooltip of the button. Currently this doesn't work as reliably as we'd like.
      More ZeroClipboard hacking is likely necessary.
    </st:attribute>
    <st:attribute name="text" use="required">
      Text to be copied into the clipboard.
    </st:attribute>
    <st:attribute name="message" use="required">
      Confirmation message to be shown once the text is copied.
      This is required as in some browsers, button doesn't properly provide feedback to user actions
      due to the nature of the hack needed to make copy work.
    </st:attribute>
    <st:attribute name="container">
      Specify the CSS selector (like ".foo") that points to the ancestor block element that has "positive:relative".
      According to ZeroClipboard documentation, having such container would improve the accuracy of invisible flash
      overlay.
